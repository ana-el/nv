It’s very easy to make a luxurious dome that looks great, but doesn’t support a population needed to run all of its services properly. In a typical dome, I devote nearly half of the real estate to residential apartments. And once I unlock the arcology spire, which provides even more housing, it becomes almost mandatory. Restaurants and hospitals are no good if they aren’t staffed, and the problem is only made worse if you have resource extraction buildings that require human labor outside the dome competing for your colonists’ time.",
